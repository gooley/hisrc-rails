Be sure to make your Rails app ready today.\r\n\r\nHow? Well, there are a lot of different approaches: \r\n* http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/\r\n* http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-images-how-they-almost-worked-and-what-we-need/\r\n\r\nThe one I like the most is [HiSRC](https://github.com/teleject/hisrc). This gem makes your live easier through two steps:\r\n\r\n* It adds HiSRC to the Rails asset pipeline – no more messing around with javascript files.\r\n* It provides a helper method to easy include HiSRC in your Rails views.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nIn your `Gemfile`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'hisrc-rails'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your `application.js`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n//= require hisrc\r\n\r\n$(function() {\r\n  $('img').hisrc();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor detailed information about available configuration options be sure to checkout the [HiSRC readme](https://github.com/teleject/hisrc#setting-up).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThis gem provides a nice little helper method to optimize your views: `responsive_image_tag`\r\n\r\n`responsive_image_tag` accepts the same options as `image_tag`, and two additional options as well:\r\n\r\n* `:'1x'` - If no 1x option is provided, the `src` is used.\r\n* `:'2x'` - If no 2x options is provided, \"@2x\" is added to the `src`. So \"rails.png\" becomes \"rails@2x.png\".\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n```ruby\r\nresponsive_image_tag(\"rails.png\")\r\n# => <img src=\"/assets/rails.png\" data-1x=\"/assets/rails.png\" data-2x=\"/assets/rails@2x.png\" />\r\n\r\nresponsive_image_tag(\"http://placehold.it/100x100\", :'1x' => \"http://placehold.it/200x200\", :'2x' => \"http://placehold.it/400x400\")\r\n# => <img src=\"http://placehold.it/100x100\" data-1x=\"http://placehold.it/200x200\" data-2x=\"http://placehold.it/200x200\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\nMany thanks to [1Mark](https://github.com/1Marc) for [his first version](https://github.com/1Marc/hisrc) of HiSRC, and to [teleject](https://github.com/teleject) for maintaining the [current version](https://github.com/teleject/hisrc) of this really great jQuery plugin. :)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
